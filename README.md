# ü§ñ Agentsflow

Easily create, connect & run autonomous [autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) AI agents from a streamlined web interface.

---

With Agentsflow it is possible to create your own agents and connect them in a flow, so you can directly see which agent is running and also interact with each of them in runtime.

It is designed to make it easy for beginners to create software, but we also aim to give advanced users the tools to explore deeper possibilities.

**üõ†Ô∏è Please note:** This project is currently in its initial stages but in active development.
